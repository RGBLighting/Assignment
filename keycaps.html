                                    This is arguably the most fun part for most people, because the keycaps contribute
                                    so much to the appearance of the final product. In the world of keycaps, there is
                                    really two main material types you can get; ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene)
                                    and PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate). You may be wondering, what the heck is ABS &
                                    PBT? Well, they are two different types of plastic with different property
                                    qualities. Both types of plastic have a different feel, sound, and look to them.

                                    ABS keycaps are the cheapest and most common plastic used for keycaps. ABS keycaps
                                    are mass produced because of how easily they are injection molded. PBT plastic is
                                    less common but is usually higher quality than ABS. ABS keycaps feel smooth and
                                    develop a greasy shine over time, while PBT keycaps feel textured and are more
                                    durable. PBT are considered superior to ABS since they are more durable and wear
                                    down less over time. That being said, there are some really nice ABS keycap sets
                                    available, and at the end of the day it comes down to user preference. Some people
                                    prefer the smooth feel of ABS while others like the textured feel of PBT.
