                            <p>Before entering the world of custom keyboards, one should first understand the
                                differences
                                between mechanical keyboards and membrane keyboards.</p>

                        <p>In this section, we will talk about the stark differences between ANSI and ISO
                            layouts on
                            mechanical keyboards.</p>

                        <p>There are many keyboard sizes and layouts available, but how do you tell the
                            difference between
                            them all? In this section we will talk about the different sizes and what makes each
                            of them unique.</p>

                        <p>Each material has its own look, feel, and weight to it, and can change the way each
                            keystroke sounds when typing. On top of that, some materials are more durable and
                            can last longer than others. Picking the right material comes down to personal
                            preference and how much you are willing to spend.</p>

                        <img src="homeimages/linearswitches.png" width="500">

                        <p>Understanding all the different mechanical switch types can be quite confusing. When
                            you really break it down, there are only three types of switches: linear, tactile,
                            and clicky.</p>

                        <p>This is arguably the most fun part for most people, because the keycaps contribute
                            so much to the appearance of the final product. In the world of keycaps, there is
                            really two main material types you can get.</p>
