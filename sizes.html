                                    them all? In this section we will talk about the different sizes and what makes each

                                    Full-sized keyboards are the go-to for people who need to do lots of data entry and
                                    require frequent use of the number pad. Full-sized keyboards are standard in offices
                                    and is what most people think of when they imagine a keyboard. The full-sized
                                    keyboards come standard with a number pad, home cluster, function keys, and arrow
                                    keys.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Full-size keyboards are great for anyone who needs to have a versatile
                                    selection of keys at their disposal, whether it be for gaming, work, or even just
                                    browsing the internet. Itâ€™s important to keep in mind, full-size mechanical
                                    keyboards can be a bit more expensive than smaller sizes because they require lots
                                    of extra switches and keycaps to complete the build.

                                    Tenkeyless keyboards typically have 87 keys, the perfect layout to balance size and
                                    functionality.
                                    Unlike full-sized keyboards, they do not havce a number pad which makes the keyboard
                                    more
                                    compact
                                    and easier to take on the go. Since most people don't use the number pad
                                    extensively, they can
                                    afford
                                    to get rid of the extra baggage without it impacting their typing experience.

                                    A more compact keyboard also allows for more desk space, so you'll be able to more
                                    comfortably write notes into a notepad on the side of your keyboard without feeling
                                    too constrained by a lack of space. Plus, your mouse will be much closer to your
                                    hand
                                    when typing, so you'll have to travel much less to reach for the mouse. Not only
                                    that,
                                    tenkeyless keyboards still have the arrow keys, home cluster and function keys, so
                                    you
                                    should still be able to game and type comfortably.

                                    60% keyboards are extremely popular among the community of gamers and mechanical
                                    keyboard enthusiasts. This is due to their small, compact and symmetrical form
                                    factor.
                                    They are also the most common size for custom keyboard builds.
                                </p>

                                    Because of their smaller size, it can be relatively cheap to buy switches and
                                    keycaps
                                    for custom builds, plus there are a variety of different PCB layouts and case
                                    designs
                                    specifically for 60% keyboards. To some people, a 60% keyboard can be right outside
                                    their comfort zone, the lack of arrow keys, home cluster, number pad and function
                                    row
                                    may make typing a whole new skill to learn. People who are looking to buy a 60%
                                    keyboard
                                    should know what they are getting into before making the purchase.
