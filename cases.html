                                    There are several different types of materials that keyboard cases can be made from.
                                    The most common two are aluminum and plastic. Aluminum and plastic are the easiest
                                    to mass produce, which is why so many keyboards are available in these two types of
                                    materials. The less common keyboard case types are acrylic and wood, to order these
                                    you will generally need to get them custom made by someone online. Or you could
                                    design these keyboards yourself, if you are DIY inclined.
                                <p>
                                    Each material has its own look, feel, and weight to it, and can change the way each
                                    keystroke sounds when typing. On top of that, some materials are more durable and
                                    can last longer than others. Picking the right material comes down to personal
                                    preference and how much you are willing to spend.

                                    Without a doubt the most common material to build a case out of, plastic is the
                                    easiest to manufacture and is the cheapest of all the material types. Typically,
                                    plastic keyboard cases are made of ABS plastic and have a metal plate to help
                                    support the structure of the case. ABS plastic is used because its relatively
                                    inexpensive and easy to liquefy when forming plastic components. On top of that,
                                    ABS plastic is resistant to corrosive chemicals and physical impact.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While plastic is the most common material to make a keyboard case out of, it is by
                                    no means the best. A lot of people describe the experience of typing on a plastic
                                    keyboard as rattily or unstable. The key strokes have more bounce to them and
                                    overall do not feel as sturdy.

                                    Aluminum cases are another common option available, they tend to be heavier and
                                    sturdier. They are a great option for someone who wants a case that feels solid and
                                    stable. Generally, aluminum cases are less flexible and more rigid than the plastic
                                    counterparts. The quality of aluminum cases can widely vary. The more upscale
                                    aluminum cases tend to have better better machining from the manufacturer, which
                                    allows for a more precise, clean case to be built. The better aluminum cases also
                                    tend to be heavier as well.
                                </p>

                                    Aluminum cases are a great choice of material for a keyboard case, but it would be
                                    in your best interest to make sure the quality of the metal is good. Or else it may
                                    make sense to go with the plastic option. Keep in mind that metal cases are more
                                    conductive, and tend to be colder in the winter, so it may be uncomfortable to touch
                                    when the temperature is low.

                                    Steel cases are much less common than aluminum, as they are much more difficult to
                                    produce and machine. Steel is generally much heavier than aluminum and is the most
                                    impact and bend resistant of the case options you can buy. It is also rust
                                    resistant.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A stainless-steel case will make the key presses feel stiff and less bouncy. This is
                                    a great option if you want a very tough, heavy case that can take a lot of abuse.
                                    Stainless-steel cases typically only come in different shades of silver/grey and are
                                    usually shiny and reflective.

                                    Wood cases not commonly used on mechanical keyboards. They require a bit more work
                                    to prepare, such as cutting, sanding, and finishing. The quality of a wood base
                                    depends mostly on the type of the wood used, and how its prepared.

                                    Wood cases offer some of the most interesting aesthetic choices, due to the
                                    different wood types and ways to produce them. Some of the most common choices are
                                    rosewood, zebra wood, and walnut. Some of the benefits to a wooden case include, a
                                    nice solid feel, unique aesthetic, and the fact that they do not bend very much.
